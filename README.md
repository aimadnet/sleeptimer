SleepTimer is a Python package that provides a sleep timer with a live timer and progress bar. It allows you to perform sleep operations with an active timer and visually track the progress using a customizable progress bar.

## Installation

You can install SleepTimer using pip:

```shell
$ pip install sleeptimer
````

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use SleepTimer in your Python script:

```python
from sleeptimer import sleep

# Set the sleep duration in seconds
duration = 10

# Start the sleep timer
sleep(duration)

# Sleep timer completed
print("Sleep timer finished!")
````

The sleep() function accepts the following options with their default values:

| Option	        | Default Value | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| seconds | (required) | Sleep duration in seconds. |
| title | "ðŸ˜´ Sleep" | Title text displayed before the timer. |
| message | "Time remaining: " | Message text displayed before the time remaining. |
| show_progress_bar	| True | Whether to show the progress bar or not. |

You can customize these options as needed to suit your requirements. For example, you can change the title, message, or disable the progress bar by setting show_progress_bar=False.
